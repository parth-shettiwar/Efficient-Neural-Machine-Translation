Code Base:  
The Folder contains 2 .ipynb files.  
1)Ours.ipynb  : Our NMT Model based on RNNsearch with adverserial training and noise added to avoid overfitting.  
2)Transformer.ipynb  : This model is based on **All you need is Attention** paper. We have ran the transformer on Multi30k Dataset.  
To run them, just upload them on a collab notebook, and run all cells.    
Both models have been trained on Multi30k English-German Dataset. The final block computes the Bleu score in each. Further more
